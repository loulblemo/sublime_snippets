# sublime_snippets

A collection of snippets for Sublime Text, for python applications. Some snippets can be useful for ML applications.

For a guide on how the snippets work, and where to put them to be able to use them:
https://docs.sublimetext.io/guide/extensibility/snippets.html

These snippets are not particularly well documented, but I leave them here just in case they might be of any use.
